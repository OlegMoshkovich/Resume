    description: `Co-founded a startup bringing tech tools into the AEC industry. We developed an engine to open IFC and STEP files, and a front-end application Share that provide integration with GitHub.`,
    expandedDescription: `We started a company with the goal of introducing IT tooling into AEC and made a strong bet on GitHub as the center of our product. GitHub, being one of the most sophisticated platforms in the world with over 100 million developers, seemed like an excellent option to host files, and its issue management system could provide AEC teams with a robust tool for managing issues. Another critical decision that set the direction for our company was our commitment to open source and open standards. We adopted IFC as the central file format for our product, as it is the most mature open standard available in the industry. We also contemplated using Matrix for the communication portion of the app and envisioned integrating it into the product.

My co-founder, who is also the CEO of the company, has a very technical background, having spent 12 years at Google working on different teams. He has a broad set of interests and deep technical expertise, which significantly influenced the direction of the company. The company became a vessel for ambitious technological exploration with the aim of integrating the latest technologies. To accomplish this task, we hired a team of experienced programmers.${<br/>}

Initially, we used the IFC.js engine as the core of the ecosystem but quickly realized that it did not offer the processing capabilities and flexibility we needed. Our lead programmer was tasked with rewriting part of the engine. We forked the original Web IFC engine and rewrote parts of it to increase flexibility and performance. We also used code generation processes made available by Hyper, creating TypeScript bindings for all the types available in IFC. This made the engine the most complete and, as far as we believe, one of the best-performing engines, benchmarked against XeoKit and another open company we were in direct competition with.

Our main partner and investor is a fully integrated company in Switzerland, and therefore the German-speaking world and Europe at large became our predominant market. Through user interviews, we established that ergonomic sharing of BIM assets was still missing in the market at the time of inception. We decided to build a lightweight web application called Share as the user-facing gateway to the ecosystem. The design of Share included the ability to open models hosted on GitHub as well as the ability to save versions of the projects as new commits on GitHub. Naturally, since GitHub keeps track of commits, any changes to the original file would be saved. One of the features of the engine was a fast query system that would enable users to edit IFC properties and add property sets, committing all of the changes to GitHub.

From the beginning, we were aware that the AEC market is notoriously difficult to penetrate, which was another reason to build the engine and control the evolution of that part of the system. This approach allowed us to open STEP files as both file formats use the EXPRESS schema, and therefore the engine was extended to open STEP files in a limited capacity.

As often happens with complex work, the schedule slipped, and the engine work occupied the most resources. GitHub integration also proved difficult, as the customers we interviewed were all interested in privately hosting the content and hosting large models, which was challenging due to GitHub's authentication system.

Another piece of the puzzle was the advancement in AI, which we introduced in the first year of the company with the text-to-image capabilities of MidJourney. We were naturally intrigued by these advancements, and given the technical abilities of the team, we set out to explore that direction opportunistically. Our idea was to develop a Discord bot that would use Share and headless Three.js to generate AI-based renderings using a link from Share. This prototype grew in scope as the work progressed, requiring additional infrastructure, which was later reused to introduce the feature into Share.

Weâ€™re a team of 4 or 5 people with large ambitions and a very complicated architecture for the system. The system is slowly coming together, with the open-source release of the engine scheduled for September, the bot functioning in Discord and in builders at the prototype level, and GitHub integration starting to function. The world does not stand still, and since our original set of ideas...`,

    description: 'Participated in the development and maintenance of the web applications Panorama, Blueprint, and Portfolio. Worked on the library of Outer Labs react components.',
    expandedDescription: `
    I joined Outer Labs in 2022, right at the beginning of COVID. The company was working on a suite of apps for Google to assist the internal design, construction, and management teams in overseeing Google's global real estate portfolio. I started working on a project called Panorama, which was an application focusing on the environmental performance of spaces by analyzing panels comprising building facades against environmental and structural performance criteria. In this application, the designer was equipped with a tool that could be used to configure the panel shading system, select a specific type of glass, and receive a score that would determine the feasibility of this specific configuration from an ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) standpoint. We used React for the front end, with the React Three Fiber package to visualize the panel. The system's backend was developed using Go, with GraphQL as the layer between the back end and the front end. The information driving the decisions came from detailed design sheets provided by structural and environmental facade consultants. In addition to focusing on the UI components, I worked with consultants to distill all of the formulas used in the calculations.

I was a flexible resource within the organization and was able to adapt to different projects. The next project I worked on was Blueprint, which was a catalog of building parts organized by type, where all of the design systems were represented. Designers could access information about all of the standard parts used in construction and download BIM (Building Information Modeling) components to use in their designs. I joined a long-term contributor to the project to assist with the UI redesign of the system.

The next project I worked on was Portfolio, an application used by interior designers to study different office layout schemes as Google was preparing to reconfigure its offices to fit the hybrid work schedule of its workforce. Users could upload existing floor plans and quickly assemble a scheme using a library of predefined pods. They could also configure the pods in the configurator to quickly assess the feasibility of the proposed design. The scheme would be evaluated against several criteria, with the final score determining the quality of the proposed design.
